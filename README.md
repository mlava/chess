You need to get an API key from https://rapidapi.com/KeeghanM/api/chess-puzzles and then enter it in the Roam Depot settings.

You can embed the board using Command Palette command 'Import the daily Chess puzzle from Lichess' or create a SmartBlock command using <%CHESSPUZZLE%>.

The Hint button shows you a hint as to the next move. The Reset button will return you to the starting positions.

The solution link will open the puzzle page on Lichess.org.
