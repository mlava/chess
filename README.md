You can embed the board using Command Palette command 'Import the daily Chess puzzle from Lichess' or create a SmartBlock command using <%CHESSPUZZLE%>.

The Hint button shows you a hint as to the next move. The Reset button will return you to the starting positions.

The solution link will open the puzzle page on Lichess.org.
