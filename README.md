No configuration is required, although you can choose your preferred board, background and piece styling in the Roam Depot settings.

You can embed the board using Command Palette command 'Daily Chess Puzzle from Lichess' or create a SmartBlock command using <%CHESSPUZZLE%>.

The board links to the puzzle on Lichess, so you can play out the game and see if your next move was correct.
You can also get a hint as to which piece to play next by focusing the Focus for Hint block beneath the board.
